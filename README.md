Refactor project to a library.Create automate setup.py &amp; __init__.py


This repository offers a set of scripts and configurations to refactor an existing project into a distributable library. It automates the process of creating initialization and setup files tailored for packaging the project as a reusable library. Once adapted, the project can be published to an artifact repository, allowing seamless installation and integration as a dependency into other projects using standard package managers.
